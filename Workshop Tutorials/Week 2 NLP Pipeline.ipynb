    "## Twitter Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "With all of the tweets circulating every second, it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company, or a person's, brand for being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in the language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. In this workshop, we'll create an NLP pipeline to predict the sentiment of each tweet."
